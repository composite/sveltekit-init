# SvelteKit Initialized

- SvelteKit

- Playwright E2E Test

## SvelteKit HOW2USE

Please refer [this repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## What are these in `dependencies`?

Don't mind. You can delete them of `dependencies` in `package.json` for start customizing own environment.
It's just fit for my work environment.
I'll clean up later for make yours quickly.
Yes. WIP.

## Can I use this repo for javascript?

Please refer eslint config, plugins, and delete typescript for using javascript.
But, you can mix typescript and javascript per `.svelte` file.
